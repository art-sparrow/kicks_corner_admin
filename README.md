## Interview Scope

The task is then to simply develop a Flutter app that allows a user to add product variants as shown in the video. The focus is on the product options and variants so you can safely assume a product has already been added. Also, consuming a web service is out of scope. We just need the UI (User Interface) and logic for capturing product option names, values, and logic for generating the variants when a user is done entering the product options.
